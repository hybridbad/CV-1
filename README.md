I am a Makers Fellow currently studying on the Makers 12 week intensive bootcamp. My background in engineering has crafted me into an extremely technical individual with a love of problem solving.

Looking to kickstart my career in the tech sector of London or surrounding Surrey areas, I would love to work in AI or Software aiming to help peoples lives for the better. The future is bright!
