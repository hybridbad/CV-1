Hi, I'm James. A Full-stack engineer.

***

I am Makers Fellowship graduate currently working as a Full Stack Engineer at the Capgemini Applied Innovation Exchange. 
My background in engineering has crafted me into an extremely technical individual with a love of problem solving. I am profoundly deaf, I want to prove to other deaf people that they can make it in the tech industry, hopefully one day I can help them in the future to achieve their dreams.

### <a name="skills">Skills</a>

- **Quick Learner** - Able to pick up new technologies quickly and effectively. In my current role in the Innovation Exchange, I need to learn new stacks quickly to create potential prototyes for clients

- **Inquisitive** - I love learning, researching anything that piques my interest, from learning about engines to cooking techniques. I relish learning about different technolgies, learning about how to be the best code craftsman I can.

- **Finer details** - Throughout my working life I have had to apply intricate attention to detail, I have gained this in my engineering background. Commissioning sensor systems where a small detail can affect the entire infrastructure. I apply this to my coding, as I learn more about syntax I can spot things very quickly.

- **Drive** - I am highly motivated, I relish a challenge. My success in getting into the Fellowship programme in Makers is an example of this, I pushed myself above and beyond to achieve my dream.

- **Team player** - I have always been a team player, willing to offer my help or experience whenever required. 

- **Adaptable** - I am profoundly deaf, adpatation comes naturally to me in this world with a hearing majority. I have worked around Europe with various teams with language barriers included!
